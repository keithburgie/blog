Choosing a career has kept me up at night since I was in middle school. It seemed like all of my friends knew what they wanted to do, and I just didn’t. I tried to figure it out, learning about different fields and occasionally trying something completely new. However, in between adventures I always came back to creating for the web, typically declaring that I hated it but was good enough at it and could get paid for it.

You see, I like to eat food and wear clothes and sleep indoors, and I need money to do these things. To make that money, I could start my own business, but I’ve tried that and don’t like the stresses that come with it. I could be a nurse, but I don’t want to work long shifts up to my elbows in bedpans. I could work in sales, but I can’t rely on commission and have a strong aversion to bullshit.

The age old career-discovery question asks, “What would you do for work if you didn’t need the money?” Well, I wouldn't build websites. I wouldn’t work at all, and that’s why it’s always been the wrong question to ask myself. I like to run, ride my bike, play frisbee, travel, eat tasty food, watch movies and take naps. There are people out there who do get paid to do all those things, but I don’t want to do the work required to get paid to do those things. I’ve had “the dream job,” where I worked within my greatest passion. And you know what? It killed my passion, and without passion it was easy to see how much the work sucked.

It seems that I choose to be a web developer because I can tolerate the unique frustrations of this career that lead to the unique payoffs that I enjoy. I like problem solving, technology, flexibility, and being able to provide financially. I like that credentials and networking matter less in this career than demonstrating that you can do the work. You will rarely find me working on a personal programming project after work, and, based on the question above, that was always reason enough for me to believe I was doing the wrong thing.

###Wanting Is More Fun Than Having
It’s easy to fantasize about life after success, a time when all your wildest dreams have come true and you’ve got millions in the bank and a great love life with your still-sexy spouse. But the reality is that most of us will never get to enjoy whatever fantasy “after” image we’ve got in mind, and the lucky ones who do might quickly find it boring.

Whatever might come next is exciting to think about, but life is happening now. This is it. You’re doing it, and it’s all you can be sure that you’ll ever have. And just like in programming, pretty much everything that comes before the project is over is about bug fixes, new features, and refactoring. Is debugging fun? If you’re hoping to become a software developer or engineer, hopefully you answered, “Well, actually, kind of.”

It’s not that we should *like* suffering for our work, it’s more that *you’re going to* suffer for your work. Your success is not the result of setting a goal, but the byproduct of what you actually do. Nobody makes a billion dollars by wanting to be rich. They get there because they enjoy the trials and tribulations of their craft, and that’s why no billionaire has ever counted the three commas in their net worth and said, “Okay, I’m done now.” Being wildly successful just gives a person more permission to do exactly what they want to do, and for these folks, what they want to do is go back to work.

Whether your pursuit is a career, a hobby, or a relationship, to be successful your feelings toward the tough parts must fall somewhere on a spectrum between tolerance and pleasure. If they don’t, then it’s time to consider cutting the cord. It is a waste of your time, literally a waste of your *life* to bang your head against the wall doing something that constantly sucks joy from your heart without ever putting it back.

<!-- ###Career
Nurses, therapists and teachers feel gratification by watching their patients or students succeed. These are also relatively stable careers where a paycheck is helpful, but far from the primary motivation.

Anyone who works with money, whether as a salesperson, investor, or even as a gambler, loves the thrill of winning (or selling) even more than they love the cash. Warren Buffett likes money, but more than that, he likes to be right.

###Hobbies
An avid gardener may gush about their love of fresh vegetables and downplay the effort they put into growing them. For every tomato there are hours of tilling, planting, watering, and trimming which they *must*, on some level, enjoy.

No one who runs marathons or rocks a six-pack at the beach goes to the gym with a goal of dropping 10 arbitrary pounds. The fittest people you see at the gym genuinely are committed to, and enjoy, the routine of their exercise.

###Relationships
Are you a single person who thinks they want to be in a long-term relationship? Despite hitting it off with people, do your relationships end after a couple months? Then you (or the people you date) may be more excited about the fantasy seen on TV and in movies than in reality.

Even if things are great between two people, life will happen. In-laws will visit, kids or pets will get sick, unexpected bills will pop up, and there will be tough conversations. If you can’t, or simply don’t want to suffer with this particular person, it just won’t last. -->

###In Summary…
So much of life is suffering, but it’s the struggle that makes the payoff feel so good. The same couch will feel amazing after a long day on your feet and terrible after a whole day of sitting on it. To summarize all of Buddhism, “to want is to suffer.” Are you working towards enlightenment and freedom from all desire? No? Then you will always suffer, and your life will be better if you choose how to do it.
