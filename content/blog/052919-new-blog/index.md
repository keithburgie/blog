Hello, I'm Keith. I've been meaning to start a project like this for a very long time. This blog runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ "GatsbyJS"), a modern, open source static site generator that uses [React](https://reactjs.org/ "ReactJS") extensively.

It's [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/keithburgie/blog) and deployed by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) via witchcraft that's above my pay grade, but simple enough to set up. The only thing that's not free forever is the totally sweet domain name, which I shelled out nearly $2.00 for.
